# Psychoacoustic Bass Enhancement Specification

## 1. Overview

Psychoacoustic Bass ("psybass") makes small, excursion-limited speakers convey bass that they cannot physically reproduce. It exploits the missing fundamental effect: when the ear hears a harmonic series (2f, 3f, 4f, ...), the brain perceives the pitch of the fundamental f even when f itself is absent. The feature extracts the low band below a configurable cutoff (the speaker's low-frequency limit), synthesizes harmonics from it with a nonlinear device (NLD), band-limits those harmonics into the speaker's reproducible range, and mixes them back into the signal. Optionally it also attenuates or removes the original un-reproducible fundamental, which reduces driver excursion and distortion at no perceptual cost.

Both platforms are supported: RP2350 uses a float TPT state-variable-filter implementation, RP2040 uses Q28 fixed-point RBJ biquads.

### Key characteristics

- **Per-output processing with one global parameter set.** A single configuration (cutoff, harmonic level, drive, character, original bass level) applies to every output channel selected by a 16-bit output mask, exactly like loudness compensation. Different speakers on different outputs that need different settings should be handled by masking and preset switching.
- **Consecutive harmonic series.** The NLD blends a full-wave rectifier (even harmonics: 2f, 4f, ...) with a driven cubic soft clipper (odd harmonics: 3f, 5f, ...). The blend produces the consecutive 2f/3f/4f series that pitches the missing fundamental correctly; either family alone tends to sound octave-shifted or hollow.
- **Level-tracking dynamics.** The rectifier path is exactly level-proportional, so harmonic level follows program bass level and the effect breathes with the music instead of pumping a constant drone.
- **Zero added latency.** The processing is pure IIR and in place; the dry signal path is never delayed. Inter-output-slot sample alignment (the firmware's hard invariant) is untouched whether the effect is on, off, or masked per channel.
- **Free original-bass control.** The low band is already split out for harmonic generation, so attenuating the original fundamental costs nothing extra.

### Signal flow (per selected output channel)

```
              +--> LP2 @ cutoff --+--> x (g_orig - 1) ------------------+
              |     (low band)    |                                     |
   in --------+                   +--> NLD --> HP2 @ cutoff             v
              |                        --> LP1 @ 4x cutoff --> x g_harm +--> out
              |                                                         ^
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
                                     (dry path, untouched)

   NLD:  even = |low|                                (full-wave rectifier)
         odd  = softclip(drive * low)                (cubic: 1.5d - 0.5d^3)
         h    = (1 - t) * even + t * odd             (t = character / 100)
```

- LP2 / HP2 are 2nd-order Butterworth (Q = 0.7071) at the cutoff frequency.
- The highpass removes the DC produced by rectification and any residual fundamental; the one-pole lowpass at 4x cutoff rolls the harmonic series off gently (6 dB/oct) so it mimics natural harmonic decay instead of sounding buzzy.
- `g_orig = 10^(original_db/20)`, `g_harm = 10^(harmonics_db/20)`.

### Signal chain position

Psybass runs **per output channel, post-matrix, pre-crossover, pre-output-EQ** (PASS 5-7 entry):

```
PASS 4:   Matrix Mixing (fan-out to output channels)
PASS 4.5: Crossfeed (per output pair)
             |
          Psychoacoustic Bass   <-- HERE (per output, masked)
             |
          Crossover -> Per-Output PEQ -> Gain/Volume -> Loudness -> Delay
             |
          Output Encoding (S/PDIF, I2S, ADAT, PDM)
```

Pre-crossover placement is deliberate: the effect must see the low band before a high-pass crossover removes it. The classic small-speaker protection recipe is a high-pass crossover at the same frequency as the psybass cutoff; psybass synthesizes the harmonics from the bass, then the crossover removes the fundamental the speaker cannot play. In that configuration leave `original_db` at 0 (the crossover already does the removal), or skip the crossover and use `original_db` instead.

Because psybass runs pre-gain, its character does not change with volume; and because it runs pre-output-EQ, per-output PEQ shapes the generated harmonics along with everything else.

## 2. Parameters

All floats on the wire are little-endian IEEE 754 single-precision. All SET values are clamped by the firmware to the documented range; a GET after a SET returns the clamped value.

### 2.1 enabled

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `bool` (uint8_t on wire) |
| **Range** | 0 (off) or 1 (on) |
| **Default** | 0 (disabled) |
| **SET command** | `0x30` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS`) |
| **GET command** | `0x31` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS`) |
| **Payload** | 1 byte: `0x00` = disabled, `0x01` = enabled |

Master enable. When disabled the coefficient pointer is unpublished and the per-output processing is skipped entirely (zero per-sample CPU cost); per-output filter states are cleared so re-enabling starts transient-free.

### 2.2 cutoff_hz

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `float` |
| **Range** | 30.0 to 300.0 (Hz) |
| **Default** | 80.0 |
| **SET command** | `0x32` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_CUTOFF`) |
| **GET command** | `0x33` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_CUTOFF`) |
| **Payload** | 4 bytes: little-endian IEEE 754 float |

The speaker's low-frequency limit. Content below this frequency feeds the harmonic generator; generated harmonics occupy roughly cutoff to 4x cutoff. Set it to the frequency below which the target speaker's output collapses (typical values: 50-60 Hz for bookshelf speakers, 80-120 Hz for small Bluetooth speakers, 150-250 Hz for laptop/phone speakers).

### 2.3 harmonics_db

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `float` |
| **Range** | -24.0 to +12.0 (dB) |
| **Default** | 0.0 |
| **SET command** | `0x34` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_HARMONICS`) |
| **GET command** | `0x35` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_HARMONICS`) |
| **Payload** | 4 bytes: little-endian IEEE 754 float |

Level of the generated harmonics mixed into the output. This is the primary "amount of effect" control. 0 dB injects the shaped harmonic band at unity relative to the NLD output; negative values make the effect subtle, positive values emphasize it. The +12 dB ceiling protects fixed-point headroom on RP2040 and applies to both platforms for parity.

### 2.4 drive_db

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `float` |
| **Range** | 0.0 to 18.0 (dB) |
| **Default** | 6.0 |
| **SET command** | `0x36` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_DRIVE`) |
| **GET command** | `0x37` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_DRIVE`) |
| **Payload** | 4 bytes: little-endian IEEE 754 float |

Pre-gain into the odd-harmonic soft clipper. Higher drive pushes quieter bass into the clipper's nonlinear region, producing a denser, more saturated odd-harmonic series and making the effect audible on quieter passages. At 0 dB only near-full-scale bass generates odd harmonics. Drive does not affect the even (rectifier) path, so at low `character` values this control does little.

### 2.5 character_pct

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `float` |
| **Range** | 0.0 to 100.0 (%) |
| **Default** | 50.0 |
| **SET command** | `0x38` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_CHARACTER`) |
| **GET command** | `0x39` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_CHARACTER`) |
| **Payload** | 4 bytes: little-endian IEEE 754 float |

Even-to-odd harmonic blend. 0% = rectifier only (even harmonics: warm, smooth, octave-flavored); 100% = clipper only (odd harmonics: harder, growlier, more "electric bass"). The 50% default gives the consecutive series that produces the strongest missing-fundamental pitch perception. Present this in a UI as a "warm ... aggressive" tone control.

### 2.6 original_db

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `float` |
| **Range** | -60.0 to 0.0 (dB) |
| **Default** | 0.0 |
| **SET command** | `0x3A` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_ORIGINAL`) |
| **GET command** | `0x3B` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_ORIGINAL`) |
| **Payload** | 4 bytes: little-endian IEEE 754 float |

Level of the original low band (below cutoff) in the output. 0 dB leaves the original bass untouched (harmonics are added on top). Negative values attenuate the fundamental the speaker cannot reproduce anyway, freeing driver excursion and amplifier headroom; -60 dB is effectively full removal. Implemented as `out += (g_orig - 1) * low`, so it is exact complementary attenuation of the LP2 band, not a shelf approximation.

### 2.7 output_mask

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Type** | `uint16_t` |
| **Range** | bit k = process output channel k; bits above the platform's channel count are ignored |
| **Default** | 0xFFFF (all outputs) |
| **SET command** | `0x3C` (`REQ_SET_PSYBASS_MASK`) |
| **GET command** | `0x3D` (`REQ_GET_PSYBASS_MASK`) |
| **Payload** | 2 bytes: little-endian uint16 |

Selects which output channels are processed. Output channel indexing:

| Platform | Bits 0-7 | PDM sub bit |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| RP2350 | outputs 0-7 (S/PDIF or I2S slots 1-4, L/R interleaved) | bit 8 |
| RP2040 | bits 0-3: outputs 0-3 (slots 1-2) | bit 4 |

Masked-off outputs cost zero per-sample CPU and have their filter state cleared each packet, so toggling a mask bit on is always transient-free. Recommendation: mask off the PDM subwoofer output (and any full-range/sub outputs), since synthesizing harmonics on a channel that can reproduce real bass is counterproductive. The all-outputs default is safe but not optimal; a typical app sets the mask to exactly the small-speaker outputs.

Mask changes take effect on the next audio packet without a coefficient recompute.

---

## 3. Vendor Command Transport

Psybass uses the standard DSPi vendor command surface, so it is reachable over every control transport (USB EP0, UART, I2C target, control surfaces engine) with the same command bytes.

### USB (primary transport)

- **SET**: control transfer, `bmRequestType = 0x40` (vendor, host-to-device), `bRequest = <command>`, `wValue = 0`, `wIndex = 0`, data stage = payload as documented per parameter.
- **GET**: control transfer, `bmRequestType = 0xC0` (vendor, device-to-host), `bRequest = <command>`, `wLength` >= response size; the device returns the payload in the data stage.

### Command summary

| Command | Direction | Payload | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 0x30 | SET | 1 byte bool | Enable/disable |
| 0x31 | GET | 1 byte bool | Enabled state |
| 0x32 | SET | 4-byte float | Cutoff (Hz, clamps 30-300) |
| 0x33 | GET | 4-byte float | Cutoff |
| 0x34 | SET | 4-byte float | Harmonic level (dB, clamps -24..+12) |
| 0x35 | GET | 4-byte float | Harmonic level |
| 0x36 | SET | 4-byte float | Drive (dB, clamps 0..18) |
| 0x37 | GET | 4-byte float | Drive |
| 0x38 | SET | 4-byte float | Character (%, clamps 0..100) |
| 0x39 | GET | 4-byte float | Character |
| 0x3A | SET | 4-byte float | Original bass level (dB, clamps -60..0) |
| 0x3B | GET | 4-byte float | Original bass level |
| 0x3C | SET | 2-byte uint16 LE | Output mask |
| 0x3D | GET | 2-byte uint16 LE | Output mask |

### Apply semantics

- Every SET updates live state immediately. Enable and the five value parameters raise an internal recompute flag; the firmware main loop rebuilds the coefficient set (double-buffered, glitch-free) and publishes it, typically within a few milliseconds. No stream interruption, no click, no alignment disturbance.
- The mask SET takes effect on the next audio packet directly (no recompute needed).
- SETs are **not persisted** to flash by themselves. Persistence happens when the user saves a preset (`REQ_PRESET_SAVE` 0x90) or via `REQ_SAVE_PARAMS` (0x51), following the same convention as loudness/crossfeed/leveller.

### Change notifications

Each SET emits a parameter-write notification on the notification endpoint (see `notification_protocol_v2_spec.md`) whose offset/length identify the changed field inside the bulk wire structure (section 4). A second host UI listening to notifications can therefore mirror psybass changes live, exactly as for the other DSP features.

---

## 4. Bulk Wire Format (GET/SET_ALL_PARAMS 0xA0/0xA1)

Psybass appears in `WireBulkParams` from **wire format version 23** as the final section. `WIRE_FORMAT_VERSION` mismatches are rejected wholesale by the firmware, so a host must speak V23 to use bulk transfer with this firmware (total packet size 5900 bytes).

`WirePsybassParams`, 24 bytes, at byte offset **5876** within `WireBulkParams`:

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| +0 | 1 | uint8 | enabled (0/1) |
| +1 | 1 | uint8 | reserved (write 0) |
| +2 | 2 | uint16 LE | output_mask |
| +4 | 4 | float LE | cutoff_hz |
| +8 | 4 | float LE | harmonics_db |
| +12 | 4 | float LE | drive_db |
| +16 | 4 | float LE | character_pct |
| +20 | 4 | float LE | original_db |

On bulk SET (0xA1), all psybass fields are applied and coefficients recompute automatically. On bulk GET (0xA0), the section reflects live state including clamping.

---

## 5. Persistence

- **Preset slots (flash):** psybass fields are stored per preset from `SLOT_DATA_VERSION` 31. Presets saved by older firmware (V21-V30) load with psybass defaults (disabled, mask 0xFFFF, cutoff 80, harmonics 0, drive 6, character 50, original 0); no data is lost or misread. Preset save (0x90) captures the live psybass state; preset load (0x91) restores it and recomputes coefficients.
- **Factory reset (0x53):** restores the defaults above.
- **Startup:** the boot preset (or factory defaults) determines the psybass state at power-on; the effect is fully initialized before audio starts.

---

## 6. App Integration Patterns

### Startup / reconnect sync

1. Read `GET_ALL_PARAMS` (0xA0) and parse the psybass section at offset 5876 (verify `format_version == 23` in the header first), **or** issue the seven individual GETs (0x31, 0x33, 0x35, 0x37, 0x39, 0x3B, 0x3D).
2. Populate the UI from the returned values. Do not assume defaults; the device may have loaded a preset.

### Live control

- Sliders should send SETs on change (they are cheap and glitch-free); read-back is unnecessary except to reflect clamping, since the firmware clamps silently. If the app enforces the documented ranges itself, its state and the device's state stay identical.
- There is no need to disable/re-enable around parameter changes; coefficient updates are seamless.

### Typical UI

A minimal UI is a single enable switch plus a "bass boost" slider mapped to `harmonics_db` (-24..+12). A full UI exposes: enable; cutoff (log slider, 30-300 Hz); harmonics (slider, dB); drive (slider, dB); character (warm-to-aggressive slider, %); original bass (slider, dB, labelled "speaker protection" or "excursion control"); per-output checkboxes building the mask.

### Suggested starting points

| Use case | cutoff | harmonics | drive | character | original |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Bookshelf speakers, gentle help | 60 | 0 | 6 | 50 | 0 |
| Small Bluetooth speaker | 100 | +3 | 9 | 40 | -12 |
| Laptop / tablet speakers | 180 | +6 | 12 | 50 | -24 |
| Headphone "more bass feel" | 45 | -3 | 6 | 30 | 0 |

### Feature detection

There is no capability bit for psybass. Detect support by firmware version, by `format_version >= 23` in the bulk header, or by issuing `REQ_GET_PSYBASS` (0x31) and treating a failed/zero-length control transfer as "unsupported" (the established pattern for loudness/crossfeed).

---

## 7. Interactions and Edge Cases

- **Crossover:** psybass runs before the per-output crossover, so a high-pass crossover does not starve it of bass. Pairing a HP crossover at the psybass cutoff with `original_db = 0` is equivalent to (and steeper than) using `original_db = -60` without a crossover.
- **Loudness compensation:** independent and compatible. Loudness runs post-gain; psybass pre-gain. Both have their own output masks.
- **Volume leveller / crossfeed:** run earlier in the chain (input side / per pair); psybass processes their output like any other content.
- **Test signals (signal generator):** outputs carrying a RAW test signal bypass psybass (as they bypass all per-output processing), so measurement signals are never colored.
- **Muted or disabled outputs:** skipped entirely; state is cleared so unmuting is transient-free.
- **Sample rate changes:** coefficients recompute automatically for 44.1/48/96 kHz; no host action needed.
- **Multichannel USB (RP2350 4/6/8-channel alts):** fully supported; psybass is input-count agnostic since it runs post-matrix.
- **Clipping headroom:** the effect adds energy. With `harmonics_db` high, hot content, and `original_db = 0`, the summed output can clip (the output meters and clip flags at channels CH_OUT_* report it). Reducing `original_db` usually buys back more headroom than the harmonics consume; otherwise lower the output gain or harmonics level.
- **CPU cost:** roughly 1.5-2x the cost of loudness compensation per enabled output. On RP2040, enabling all outputs at 96 kHz is the worst case; monitor `cpu0_load`/`cpu1_load` in `REQ_GET_STATUS` if you enable it broadly. Masked-off outputs cost nothing.
